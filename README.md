# Zack's Python Rasterizer

I decided to make my own 3D engine in Python using PyGame.

At the start you will be given a couple options before the engine starts, allowing you to import your own obj file, and picking the shading method.

I wrote it to be as easy to modify as I could make it, so feel free to adjust the parameters and stuff.
